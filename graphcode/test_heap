//There are 2 types of Insert functionality supported
//insertE(vectorOfKey,size); and insertE(vectorOfKey,vectorOfValue,size);

//also according to the functionality used for insert, delete will work accordingly
// if let's say you want to delete n elements and you have used insertE(vectorOfKey,size) then deleteE will return a vector of n elements which represents only key
// if let's say you want to delete n elements and you have used insertE(vectorOfKey,vectorOfValue,size) then deleteE will return a vector of 2n elements which represents
// both key and pair and indexex 0....n-1 contains the keys and indexes n....2n-1 contains the values corresponding to them (i.e value corresponding to index at ith key will
// be given by index at i+n)

//also if we are deleting n elements the returned vector is always sorted in ascending order.
